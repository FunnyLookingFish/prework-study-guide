# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose and goal of this project has been to collect and store all of the information and notes that I have accumulated and made througout the prework process. I was motivated to make it as aesthetically appealing and succinct as possible for myself. To better keep track of, not only my notes, but also keep track of my progress as I slowly improve and update my site as I learn more during the bootcamp experience. Organization, as many topics were covered throughout the course of the prework, this helps in getting the notes sorted in the correct place for easy reference. From this process it was easy to learn how each of the different languages interact with one another and how writting code in order matters.
